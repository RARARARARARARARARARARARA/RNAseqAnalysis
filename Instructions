Hi Ryan,

Thanks for taking the time to interview with Catalytic just now.  Please find the assessment below.  Good luck!

For the next step in the hiring process, we would like for you to perform a technical assessment challenge. For this exercise, we would like for you to identify and download an Open Access RNA-seq dataset. The goal of the challenge is for you to process the raw data files and perform some downstream analysis (e.g., differential expression analysis, pathway analysis, etc.). We would like for you to provide scripts along with the results (figures, tables, etc.). Please make your assessment human therapeutic focused with an emphasis on the interpretation of the results and discussion/rationale for the methods chosen. This assessment is time-bound and should be submitted by the end of day Sunday.  Please be in touch with any questions. 

Best,
Kuan
